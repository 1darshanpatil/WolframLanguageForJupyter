# Wolfram Language kernel for Jupyter notebooks

Developer: Chris Cooley

Jupyter provides a protocol (ZMQ) to connect their notebooks to various languages. This project defines a Wolfram Language kernel which can be used in Jupyter notebooks.


# Installation

Run the following command in a terminal:
  
    ./addKernel.sh "/path/to/WolframKernel"

This adds the Wolfram Language kernel to Jupyter's database of kernels and allow you to select "Wolfram Language" from the Jupyter notebook interface.

To check the list of Jupyter kernels, run the following commands:

    jupyter kernelspec list

 the wrapper to Jupyter's internal database of kernels, allowing the "Wolfram Language" to be selected at the Jupyter Notebook's startup. If the location of WolframKernel changes, you will have to re-run the above.

Then run the following in the root directory.

    jupyter notebook

# Usage

Once the "Wolfram Language" has been selected, and the wrapper has finished starting up, you should see an empty In[]: cell. Just type your input into that cell, as you would for the normal Mathematica Front End, and press Shift-Enter.

If the wrapper can determine for sure that the output can be properly represented as text, it will do so. If not, the output will be in the form of an image.

Any errors that occur during the evaluation of the input will be displayed.

Wrap your input with Interact[] to upload the output to the cloud, and embed that cloud object in the Jupyter Notebook.
NOTE: This requires that you are signed in to the cloud within the Wolfram Kernel.
